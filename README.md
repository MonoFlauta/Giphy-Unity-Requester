# Giphy Unity Requester
The Giphy Unity Requester is a wrapper that tries to simplify the use of the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/). Your calls will end up being very simple thanks to this wrapper and the use of [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx).
## About the API
Everything you need to know about the Giphy API can be found in their [documentation]((https://developers.giphy.com/)). Apart from this you should be able to test the API by yourself [here](https://developers.giphy.com/explorer/) if you already have an API key created.
## About the wrapper
Even you can use the API directly and make the calls by yourself, this tool should provide a simplified way to make the calls so you don't have to worry about the api key more than in a scriptable object and don't have to check the api paths.
